# Etch-a-Sketch

Odin Project Assignment : [Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

Main goal was practice concepts as FlexBox, DOM and events manipulation, loops, list,etc.

I developed all possible functionalities:

- "New Grid" button allows the user to create a new grid with customs resolution between 1 and 100 pixels.
- "Clear" button remove the current sketch, but mantain grid resolution. All other default settings are used now.
- "Opacity" make a square darker with each new hover interaction.
- "Color" randomizes color used to draw (default is black).

Color and Opacity modes can be combined.
